# FPV Drone with Controllable Hook

## Summary

I want to build a FPV drone from scratch that will allow me to fly around the house and pick up/drop off small objects. I am very excited to build this as this is a hobby I was always very interested in and want to explore further. The drone will also require custom flight software to be written so it can handle picking/dropping the small objects and I am very excited to work on it.

## Plan

Tools to be used:
-	Screwdriver (Phillips or Flathead)
-	Soldering kit

The first major step is assembling the drone. That includes:
-	Building the frame
-	Attaching motors to frame
-	Solder motor wires to onboard flight computer chip
-	Connect battery


After drone is assembled, it has to be tuned and calibrated in order to fly properly. I plan on using a software called BetaFlight, which will allow me to write code to control the motors and read the onboard gyroscope values. Once I write the code, I will have to flash it to the onboard chip on the drone.
